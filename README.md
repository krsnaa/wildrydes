This application architecture demonstrates end-to-end authentication and authorization patterns through the use of [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/). A single page [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) web app hosts the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render the front-end which then connects to a public serverless backend API built using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Amazon Cognito provides user identity management and authentication functions to secure the backend API. Finally, DynamoDB provides a persistence layer where data is stored and retrieved via the API's Lambda function.
